<pre><code>New ways to learn (Machine learning)

Before starting with the basic concepts of machine learning, it is important to enter into context with a simple example of this beautiful world of machine learning.
Let’s answer a simple question, what is a dog may seem silly but it is difficult to give an exact description of what it is at the time with this I mean when we see a dog for the first time, it is very similar as when we Question that is a tree Everyone knows what a tree is but in the first instance the definition and interpretation of what a tree is not present if not later than when under experience and recognition we identify what a tree is, We all know what a tree is but finding the right definition is not.
A clear example of learning and understanding to identify what a tree is well illustrated in the following image, where we can see what a tree is but other elements are similar but at the time we do not know for sure if it is also a tree or not and To do this, we must ask someone else who has that experience and knowledge necessary to be able to instruct whether or not it is a tree and based on this, we can correctly identify what a tree is and what is not...

<h2>Author’s disclaimer</h2>
<pre><code>Welcome to the Python world!

After 3 months of C, you will start Python today.
The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

Enjoy!
- Guillaume, CTO at Holberton

<h3>Zen</h3>
<pre><code>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
